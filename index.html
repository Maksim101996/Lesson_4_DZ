					Tesla introduced the Model Y car in March last year, deliveries to customers started on March 13, 2020, so it's time to consider what is the difference between the Tesla Model Y and Model 3 electric car, these models are the cheapest in the Tesla model range (earlier my colleague Ramis compared the interior of the Model Y and Model 3). But before that, let's generally understand what kind of cars the Tesla line consists of. The company offers us: ModelS, Model 3, Model X and Model Y. Have you ever wondered how all these models differ? I, for example, am not. But now we'll figure it out with you. The Model S is a luxury sedan, expensive, big and fast. Model 3 is the cheapest model of the company, a budget sedan, you can say "bum-car". The Model X is a fancy crossover, an analogue of the BMW X5, and besides, it is the most expensive in the line, but the Model Y, in my opinion, the most interesting option is a crossover that is comparable in price to the cheap Model 3, but surpasses it in all respects.

					Во-первых, у компании не было дешевого кроссовера, во-вторых, в мире — и особенно в США, да и в России — всё большую популярность получают именно кроссоверы, и Model Y в этом вопросе за счёт новых технологий и относительно низкой стоимости может стать, вероятно, самым успешным продуктом Tesla.
					Кроссовер вместительней чем обычный седан, у него больше места под грузы, выше клиренс и лучше обзор. При этом по габаритам кроссовер занимает на дороге и парковке столько же места, как и обычный седан.

					The Tesla Model X is such a cool car that even Hollywood stars are not afraid to use it in clips. The Model Y is a budget version of the Model X, which makes the car even more cool, because outwardly you will hardly notice the difference between X and Y, unless of course the rear doors of the Model X are open. They open up at her, this mechanism is called the "gull wing".

					The advantages of Tesla cars are also that they have special filters that allow you to activate the "Biological Weapons Protection Mode". In this mode, the car protects passengers from viruses, bacteria, mold and pollen entering the cabin. Thus, on Tesla, you can easily navigate around Wuhan, which has become the source of the COVID-19 coronavirus, our colleagues from Hi-News.ru we wrote detailed material about the new virus, you can study it.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p id="green-codystar">
					The Model 3 is still the cheapest electric car of the company. On the official website, the car can be purchased for $ 40,000, while the BMW 430i, which can be compared with the Model 3, is sold in the United States at a price of $ 44,000. Of course, the difference is small, and probably sports car lovers will choose BWM, but Tesla is about technology. A competitor of Modeli can be called BMW X3, the devices have similar dimensions, but it is worth noting that the X3 is priced at 42 thousand dollars, which makes it a more interesting option for those who want to save money. Recently, our author and my colleague Artem Sutyagin wrote a piece in which he stated that electric cars have no future. This statement is, of course, funny and amusing. What do you think?
				</p>
				<br>
				<p id="green-goldman">
					The trunks of the car are much larger than those available in the Model 3. Yes, there is no motor in electric cars, which means there are two trunks. The Model Y offers 1.5 cubic meters of luggage space compared to 0.14 cubic meters of the Model 3. The Model Y has 3 rear seats, and now they can also be folded with buttons inside the trunk, in the Model 3 they are folded only through the handles on the rear seats. In addition, if in the Model 3 they were folded in a ratio of 60/40 (two seats or one), in the case of the Model, each seat, including the central one, can be folded separately.
				</p>

			<br>
			<div class="blue-text">
				<p id="blue-montserrat">
					The seats in the ModelY are very similar to those used in the Model 3, but they are fixed on special racks, which makes the landing much higher. The legroom in Y for the rear passengers was increased by 15%, and for the front by 2%. The distance above the head in Model Y is almost the same as in Model 3 — the difference is 1-2%.Editor's Note: Judging by the video and photos, the Model Y has a Model 3 interior inside, and if this is the case, then it is not necessary to compare the interior trim and its quality with BMW or Mercedes, the materials and assembly of the Telsa interior are much worse than the entire Bavarian troika. You will drive your Model 3 very fast, there will be perfect silence inside, but the feeling of finishing inside the car is comparable to Hyundai. Not everyone is ready to trade the quality of BMW trim.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p id="blue-sfprodisplay">
					The Model Y can offer its owners a panoramic roof for both front and rear passengers. In the new model, the company additionally placed a gasket inside the front hood cover so that water does not get into the front trunk. Many people scolded the car for the lack of additional mechanical door opening handles for rear passengers in case the car's battery ran out. The Model Y fixed the problem — now all passengers in an emergency situation will be able to open the car doors.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p id="blue-cormorantInfant">
					A few words should be said about the wheels. In the Model Y, they have become noticeably wider, this will allow the car to stay on the road better and enter turns, and at the same time, in the Model Y, the mileage from a single charge has been noticeably improved (up to 508 kilometers), in the Model 3, the base version is able to travel only 402 kilometers (price $ 39,000). Which, however, is also not bad. And, probably, it would be more correct to compare the Model Y with the "Long Range" version of the Model 3, which is capable of driving 518 kilometers on a single charge and is priced at 49 thousand dollars. In this case, of course, the Model 3 looks more attractive.
				</p>
				<br>

					First of all, the Model Y is a crossover, so its main difference lies precisely in the size. The Model Y is only slightly inferior in size to the Model X. However, it is worth noting that the Model X costs about $ 100,000, while the "Long Range" version of the Model Y can be bought for only $ 53,000, the version with increased power (Performance) will cost 61,000, which is also not bad.

					Unfortunately, the cheapest - conventional - modification will begin to be sold only in the spring of 2021 at a price of $ 39,000, which will make the car even more attractive in comparison with the Model 3. But here we must remember that the Model 3 was offered in the USA for $ 35,000, but then this offer was removed from the site Tesla.com

					<mark>ITALIC 700 </mark>In March 2019, Elon Musk showed the world the long-awaited Tesla Model Y electric car, which is a cross between a passenger car and a truck. Such cars are better known as crossovers and are great for family people who often go on trips with a bunch of different things. Many people made a pre-order for the novelty last year and very soon, during March 2020, they will begin to receive their long-awaited cars. It is known that the crossover is assembled on the platform of a relatively inexpensive Tesla Model 3 car, but between them, as expected, there are many differences. The most interesting distinctive features of the novelty are in its interior.
				</p>

			<div class="purple-text">
				<p id="purple-rowdies">Today, consumers are increasingly opting for crossovers, because this is a convenient body type. And the Model Y option seems more attractive in comparison with the Model 3, it's something in between a full-size crossover and a regular sedan, and that's its plus. It is compact enough so that it can be conveniently navigated through narrow city streets, and, meanwhile, it is not so small and is perfect for a large family. The Model Y is the perfect car for practical people who want to be on trend and sometimes like to go out into nature. In Russia, the Modeli can become the most successful Tesla car due to its high ground clearance.</p>
				<br>
				<p id="purple-quintessential">
					The features of the interior of an electric car were described by the publication CleanTechnica with reference to the account @mrleetesla on Twitter. One of the Tesla fans managed to photograph the Tesla Model Y interior from different angles, which shows that the interior of the crossover is much wider than that of a passenger electric car. Like any good passenger truck, the novelty has quite a roomy trunk, in which, if necessary, you can put travel bags or even put a bicycle. There are no exact dimensions of the cabin and trunk at the moment, but in the photos the capacity of the Tesla Model Y seems impressive. It won't be crowded, at least, for sure.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p id="purple-synetactile">
					The door panels of the novelty are lined with black alcantara, which is also known as artificial suede. In general, the entire interior of the novelty is made in a dark style, which gives it a solid look. What material is covered with the center console of the novelty, on which the dashboard, touch screen and controls are installed, is not visible in the photos. If it is the same as the Tesla Model 3, crossover owners will have to handle it as carefully as possible, because it is highly susceptible to contamination and scratches. It remains to be hoped that the company took into account the negative reviews and corrected this imperfection.
